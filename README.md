# HTML5 & CSS3 Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of simple HTML and CSS projects that explore various web design concepts and layout techniques.

Each project is designed **without** JavaScript, focusing entirely on HTML5 and CSS3 to demonstrate the power and potential of creating flexible and responsive layouts using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and other CSS properties.

The projects are implemented using my own unique approaches and methods.
